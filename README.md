# Secure-Data-Transmission-using-RSA
 Encoded theory of RSA algorithm using Bit vector libraries to generate 2048-bit keys for secure data transfer. 

EXPERIMENTAL AND COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS

INTERFACE: Python 2.7.13 for programming in python.
ENVIRONMENT: PyCharm as the integrated development environment, for code analysis,as a graphical debugger, an integrated unit tester and for integration.
SYSTEM: Windows 10 (also compatible with Mac and Linux).

LIBRARIES:
Bit Vector: The Bit Vector class for a memory efficient packed representation of bit arrays and for logical operations on such arrays.
Random: This module implements pseudo-random number generators for various distributions.
